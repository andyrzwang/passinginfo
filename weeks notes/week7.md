## Armed conflict and war
Theme 11, 8, 3, 4

11. International perspectives on ‚Äúsecurity‚Äù are
contextual.

The perspectives and sources of information we have access to 
determine what is an issue of security for us as the general 
population. In other words, ‚Äùsecurity‚Äù and urgent issues of 
security change depending on where you are (geography) and 
change with time (when you are looking at the issue).

To really analyze conflict we need to look at structural causes 
and not just address symptoms (continued on next slide).

Key Vocabulary & Definitions:
Realism: A theory in international relations that emphasizes state sovereignty, military power, and national interest. States operate in an anarchical international system without a higher authority.

Human Security: A concept that focuses on protecting individuals from threats like poverty, disease, and environmental disasters‚Äînot just military threats.

Realpolitik: Political realism or practical politics, often associated with power balancing and alliances.

Neoconservatives: U.S. political movement favoring the use of military force and the spread of democracy to ensure security.

WMDs (Weapons of Mass Destruction): Nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons capable of large-scale destruction.

Zones of Peace / Turmoil: Concept dividing the world into stable, wealthy regions and unstable, conflict-ridden areas.

Psychic Numbing: The tendency to disengage emotionally from large-scale threats due to their overwhelming nature.

üîç Key Ideas and Perspectives:
1. Traditional Security (Realism):
Rooted in classical thought; sees the state as the main actor.

Emphasizes military strength and power politics.

Believes that international relations are anarchic and states must ensure survival through force or diplomacy.

‚ÄúStates therefore have no choice but to engage in the strategies of realpolitik... Any state that fails to do so may be moral, but it may not survive.‚Äù

2. Post-Cold War Shift:
Collapse of the Soviet Union sparked a rethinking of global security.

Francis Fukuyama famously declared the "End of History," predicting a universal liberal democracy.

‚ÄúWe may be witnessing the end of history... the universalization of Western liberal democracy.‚Äù ‚Äì Francis Fukuyama (1989)

3. Human Security:
Emerged after the Cold War; prioritizes individual well-being over state sovereignty.

Encompasses threats like disease, hunger, environmental degradation, and civil conflict.

Supported by countries like Canada, Norway, and Japan.

‚ÄúTo many, there is little doubt that the traditional state-based security paradigm is failing... none of which fall under the mandate of current security thinking.‚Äù

4. Critics of Human Security:
Barry Buzan and Roland Paris argue that it's too vague and risks making every issue a security issue.

Some developing countries see it as a tool for neocolonialism or Western interference.

‚ÄúHuman security is like ‚Äòsustainable development‚Äô‚Äîeveryone is for it, but few people have a clear idea what it means.‚Äù ‚Äì Roland Paris

5. New Threats & Challenges:
Terrorism, cyberattacks, pandemics, and nonstate actors challenge traditional views.

Global surveillance, particularly after 9/11, raises concerns about privacy and rights.

The rise of China, Russia, and North Korea reflects the enduring relevance of Realism.

‚ÄúThe old liberal order in international affairs appears to be crumbling... Realism has regained power as an ideological framework.‚Äù






## Effective altruism

Effective altruism (EA) is a philosophy and community focused on maximizing positive impact by using evidence and reason to identify and prioritize the most effective ways to help others. It encourages individuals to focus on the most pressing problems and choose actions that are likely to yield the greatest good for the greatest number of people. 
Here's a more detailed breakdown:
Prioritizing Impact:
EA encourages individuals to prioritize their efforts to maximize their positive impact on the world. 
Evidence-Based Approach:
EA emphasizes using evidence and rational arguments to identify the most effective ways to help others. 
Focusing on High-Impact Causes:
EA often encourages individuals to focus on neglected or under-resourced problems where they can make the biggest difference. 
Long-Term Thinking:
Some EA approaches, like 80,000 Hours, emphasize long-term career choices that can have a greater overall impact. 
Charitable Giving:
EA often encourages people to donate a significant portion of their income to highly effective charities. 
Community and Action:
EA is not just a philosophy; it's also a community of individuals who take action to make the world a better place. 


### The Logic of Effective Altruism

Effective altruism is based on a very simple idea: we should do the most good we can. Obeying the usual rules about not stealing, cheating, hurting, and killing is not enough, or at least not enough for those of us who have the good fortune to live in material comfort, who can feed, house, and clothe ourselves and our families and still have money or time to spare. Living a minimally acceptable ethical life involves using a substantial part of our spare resources to make the world a better place. Living a fully ethical life involves doing the most good we can.

Most effective altruists are millennials‚Äîmembers of the first generation to have come of age in the new millennium. They are pragmatic realists, not saints, so very few claim to live a fully ethical life. Most of them are somewhere on the continuum between a minimally acceptable ethical life and a fully ethical life. That doesn‚Äôt mean they go about feeling guilty because they are not morally perfect. Effective altruists don‚Äôt see a lot of point in feeling guilty. They prefer to focus on the good they are doing. Some of them are content to know they are doing something significant to make the world a better place. Many of them like to challenge themselves to do a little better this year than last year.

Effective altruism is notable from several perspectives. First, and most important, it is making a difference to the world. Philanthropy is a very large industry. In the United States alone there are almost one million charities, receiving a total of approximately $200 billion a year, with an additional $100 billion going to religious congregations. A small number of these charities are outright frauds, but a much bigger problem is that very few of them are sufficiently transparent to allow donors to judge whether they are really doing good. Most of that $200 billion is given on the basis of emotional responses to images of the people, animals, or forests that the charity is helping. Effective altruism seeks to change that by providing incentives for charities to demonstrate their effectiveness. Already the movement is directing tens of millions of dollars to charities that are effectively reducing the suffering and death caused by extreme poverty.

Second, effective altruism is a way of giving meaning to our own lives and finding fulfillment in what we do. Many effective altruists say that in doing good, they feel good. Effective altruists directly benefit others, but indirectly they often benefit themselves.

Third, effective altruism sheds new light on an old philosophical and psychological question: Are we fundamentally driven by our innate needs and emotional responses, with our rational capacities doing little more than laying a justificatory veneer over actions that were already determined before we even started reasoning about what to do? Or can reason play a crucial role in determining how we live? What is it that drives some of us to look beyond our own interests and the interests of those we love to the interests of strangers, future generations, and animals?

Finally, the emergence of effective altruism and the evident enthusiasm and intelligence with which many millennials at the outset of their careers are embracing it offer grounds for optimism about our future.

Effective altruists do things like the following: living modestly and donating a large part of their income‚Äîoften much more than the traditional tenth, or tithe‚Äîto the most effective charities; researching and discussing with others which charities are the most effective or drawing on research done by other independent evaluators; choosing a career in which they can earn most, not in order to be able to live affluently but so that they can do more good; talking to others, in person or online, about giving, so that the idea of effective altruism will spread; giving part of their body‚Äîblood, bone marrow, or even a kidney‚Äîto a stranger.


### Responses to "The Logic of Effective Altruism"

First, on individuals and institutions: although greater altruistic feeling and behavior should be an unmitigated good, assigning to individuals and groups the roles typically reserved for societal institutions poses some dangers. We expect local and national law enforcement to fight crime, for instance. We may at first welcome vigilantes but soon discover their actions are fueled by bias, group psychology, and unchecked power. Even worse, they may start eroding society‚Äôs trust in public institutions. Why should we pay for police when others protect us?

In the case of philanthropy, the problem isn‚Äôt street justice but replacing the government‚Äôs role in, say, providing health care. ‚ÄúSo what?‚Äù one might ask, given the track record of some states. But consider the long-term consequences. When key services we expect from states are taken over by other entities, building trust in the state and developing state capacity in other crucial areas may become harder. Correspondingly, convincing people to engage in politics and oversight of the state also becomes more difficult. In much of the developing world, from Pakistan to Nigeria or Haiti, where state-society relations are already frayed, they may become harder to mend.

Second, on effective measurement: we cannot measure accurately which organizations use resources most effectively. More evidence is always preferred, but precise measurement of the social value of a donated dollar may be impossible. What is the social value of a dollar given to Amnesty International as opposed to Oxfam or an NGO providing vaccines or textbooks? Every measurement involves value judgments. How much more valuable is to save the life of a one-year-old than to send a six-year-old to school?

But the problem is thornier still. A large body of research shows that economic development is the best way to lift millions out of poverty and improve their health, education, and access to public amenities. So one has to take into account how charities‚Äô activities affect economic development, which is essentially impossible. If, as some economists and political scientists suggest, changes in political and economic institutions are critical for long-run economic growth, then watchdog organizations such as Amnesty may be essential for transforming dysfunctional regimes. Effective altruists don‚Äôt (yet?) see the importance of these more political organizations. If this narrow focus continues, it may divert public and media priorities from political factors underpinning economic development.

Finally, on what we value as a society: effective altruists‚Äô imperative to maximize their earnings so they can give more might influence what society views as a meaningful life. Many of us would consider the life of a young person who foregoes the comforts of a well-paying job to work as a community activist or a doctor in a war zone not just meaningful but also highly valuable for society. But effective altruism may slowly chip away at this conception.

Perhaps Bill Gates, who has made billions and is now giving large sums to worthy causes, should be emulated. Or perhaps we should become Wall Street traders to maximize our earnings and donations. Peter Singer says there is no justification for breaking the law or engaging in blatantly unethical behavior to do so, but life‚Äôs choices seldom come in black and white. Imagine that the Department of Justice and the European Commission had not prevented Microsoft from forming a more effective software monopoly; Gates‚Äôs wealth could then be twice what it is today, and he could give twice as much. Would his have been a more meaningful and socially valuable life, even if his additional earnings came at the expense of monopoly distortions of the software market? Or suppose our Wall Street trader‚Äînow engaged in the sort of high-frequency, algorithmic arbitrage many economists view as socially useless at best‚Äîhad become an innovator, earning less and giving less but creating tools that millions find valuable. Would hers be a less meaningful life? What about civic duty‚Äîbeing an informed citizen, an active political participant ready to speak out against injustice, and a member of society willing to help others directly? Is that not part of a meaningful life?

None of these objections will have much force if effective altruists remain a small, marginal tribe. But we may yet see the best and brightest in our colleges and high-prestige professions join them. If that happens, the unforeseen consequences of this powerful but flawed idea could be stark.
