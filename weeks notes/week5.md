## reading

International law does not have a specific document specifying how it is made; there is no treaty on the correct ways and processes for making international law. Instead, the Statute of the ICJ contains a listing of instruments that the Court may apply in deciding cases, and it is this listing that is often used as a starting point for a discussion of the sources of the law.

**How Is International Law Constructed and Created?**

International law is created through several key sources defined by the UN Charter and International Court
of Justice (IO):
1. Treaties and Conventions (e.g. Geneva Conventions, Paris Agreement)
• Binding agreements signed and ratified by states.
2. Customary International Law
• Long-standing practices accepted as legal obligations (e.g. diplomatic immunity).
3. General Principles of Law
• Shared legal ideas from major national systems (e.g. fairness, equity).
4. Judicial Decisions & Legal Scholarship
• Interpretations by international courts (e.g. IO, ICC) and expert writings.
5. United Nations Resolutions
• Not always legally binding, but carry strong political influence.

**How Do Countries Follow International Law?**

Reputation & diplomacy – violating law damages a country’s standing.
Reciprocity – abiding by rules ensures others do too.
Economic incentives – trade agreements, aid, and cooperation often depend on compliance.
Domestic incorporation – many treaties are written into national law.

**How Does International Law Prevent Violations?**

1. Monitoring and Reporting
• International organizations track compliance (e.g. IJN, WTO, IAEA).
2. Diplomatic Pressure & Sanctions
• Other states or coalitions may impose penalties (e.g. economic sanctions, travel bans).
3. Legal Enforcement
• Cases brought to international courts (e.g. ICJ, International Criminal Court).
4. Shaming & Soft Power
• Public exposure and loss of legitimacy can discourage violations (e.g. human rights abuses).
5. Collective Action
• Alliances or organizations (like NATO or LIN) may intervene in extreme cases.


**tools for enforcement**
ICJ Rulings - Resolve disputes between states (e.g. border conflicts).
UN Security Council - Can authorize sanctions or military intervention.
WTO Dispute Body - Enforces trade rules and authorizes retaliatory tariffs.
ICC - Prosecutes individuals for war crimes, genocide, etc.
Sanctions - Restrict trade, finance, or travel to punish violators.
Peacekeeping Missions - Help enforce ceasefires and protect civilians.
