**north vs south korea**
The Korean Peninsula was divided into North and South Korea in 1948 after World War II, following the Japanese surrender. The division was formalized with the establishment of two separate governments: the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) and the Republic of Korea (South Korea). The Korean War, which lasted from 1950 to 1953, further solidified the division, though the conflict ended in an armistice agreement rather than a peace treaty.

South Korea:
South Korea experienced substantial economic development and transitioned from a military dictatorship to a liberal democracy. 
North Korea:
North Korea remained under the rule of the Kim family, with a one-party state and a more isolated and authoritarian government. 
Ongoing Dialogue:
Despite the division, both nations have engaged in diplomatic dialogues since the 1970s in an attempt to ease tensions.
