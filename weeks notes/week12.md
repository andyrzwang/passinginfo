2 Law, identity documents and 
passports are imbued with global 
power relations and limit mobility 
on that basis
6 An increasingly interconnected world 
may be new, but many of the inequities 
of the global system (discussed in the 
previous themes) are reproduced as the 
world becomes more connected
8. . International development, 
inequality and its impacts 
12. Migration (specifically the movement and mixing 
of people from across the world) has been crucial to 
how global societies have evolved. (Therefore, 
denying that diversity is a political act.


## notes: 

what is modernity

Harold Laski in 1919
The modern state is seen not as a natural or eternal entity but as a product of historical and social development, shaped by the needs and structures of human society.
He argues that understanding the mechanisms of the state is crucial because outside of the state-context, life becomes largely unintelligible.

He notes that modern life is marked by increasing interdependence, using the example of a New York millionaire’s decisions affecting workers in Bombay. 

Adom Getachew - book "Worldmaking after Empire" in 2019
Getachew challenges the traditional narrative of decolonization, which claims that postcolonial states were granted inclusion in international society through sovereign equality. She argues this narrative sets up postcolonial states for failure by portraying their nation-building efforts as inherently flawed and naïve.
She opposes the view that postcolonial states simply copied European institutions and were “doomed to failure.”
Introduces a powerful concept: “worldmaking.” She argues that the struggle of postcolonial nations was not just to build nations, but to restructure international society itself. 


Laski vs. Getachew — The Core Difference

Laski (1919)
Sees the modern state as an internal, historical evolution of human society.

Emphasizes universal political mechanisms, inherited traditions, and domestic structures.

The state emerges naturally over time as the central form of human association.

Focus is on the internal logic and development of the state within Western society.

Getachew (2019)
Sees the modern state as a global, postcolonial political struggle.

Argues that true state sovereignty for postcolonial nations requires restructuring the international system.

The state is not just about internal governance but about challenging global inequalities.

Focus is on worldmaking, not just nation-building — it’s a radical project to reshape the world order.

### WTO
for greater stability and regulate trade and provide monitoring to make sure global agreements work


outsourcing
- walmart uses transnational outsourcing and commodity chains to create very profitable low price products
- american works would benefits more if used american labour
- american labour is expensive, and can cause the price to go up

Rich countries fear that trade with poorer nations threatens their economic prosperity and workers' wages. Ironically, a few decades ago, it was poor countries that feared trade with rich countries.

like globalization in economy and labour involves spread of goods and services, the globalization of financial instruments and investments.


### Gig economy
The gig economy is a labor market characterized by short-term, flexible, or freelance jobs—often facilitated through digital platforms or apps. Instead of having full-time, permanent positions with one employer, workers in the gig economy typically take on individual “gigs” or tasks for various clients or companies.
- flexible
- platform based
- independent contracts
- task based pay
- limited benefits

like Uber, doordash

rise of digital labour = 
- rising unemployment
- rapidly increasing connectivity
- contracts to outsourcing, there is a need for more jobs in places they do not exist



## reading notes

**TRANSNATIONAL ECONOMY AND GLOBAL LABOR - text book**

globalization also involves culture, communications, political and ideological changes, and much more. Even economic globalization is much more complicated than simply the rise of transnational corporations.

It involves the globalization of manufacturing;
the distribution, ownership, and control of goods and services; and the
globalization of financial instruments and investments. Ultimately, it leads
to a major transformation in the way in which global business is conducted.


outsourcing
- change geographic of production
- china, asia
- labour rights
- no uniform laws to protect everyone
- walmart - sources
- apple - supply chain
