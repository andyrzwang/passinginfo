quote - 
The idea of democracy as a universal commitment is quite new, and it is quintessentially a
product of the twentieth century. The rebels who forced restraint on the king of England
through the Magna Carta saw the need as an entirely local one. In contrast, the American
fighters for independence and the revolutionaries in France contributed greatly to an
understanding of the need for democracy as a general system.

**Democracy and economic development**
It is often claimed that nondemocratic systems are better at bringing about economic development. This belief sometimes goes by the name of “the Lee hypothesis,” due to its advocacy by Lee Kuan Yew, the leader and former president of Singapore.

**functions of democracy**
include voting and respect for election
results, but it also requires the protection of liberties and freedoms, respect for legal
entitlements, and the guaranteeing of free discussion and uncensored distribution of news
and fair comment. 

Democracy is a demanding system, and not just a mechanical condition (like
majority rule) taken in isolation.

1. political freedom is a part of human freedom in general, and exercising civil and political rights is a crucial part of good lives of individuals as social beings. Political and social participation has intrinsic value for human life and well-being. 

2. enhancing the hearing that people get in expressing and supporting their claims to political attention

3. practice of democracy gives citizens an opportunity to learn from one another, and helps society to form its values and priorities. Even the idea of “needs,” including the understanding of “economic needs,” requires public discussion and exchange of information, views, and analyses.


**universality of values**
There is a plurality of virtues here, including, first, the intrinsic importance of
political participation and freedom in human life; second, the instrumental importance of
political incentives in keeping governments responsible and accountable; and third, the
constructive role of democracy in the formation of values and in the understanding of needs,
rights, and duties.
