## States and nations
Theme 1, 4

def of nation - google
a large body of people united by common descent, history, culture, or language, inhabiting a particular country or territory.

Different ways of thinking about nationalism.
1. Nationalism is used by elites to gain or maintain control. It is therefore tied to forms of oppression 
or conflict. These scholars see nationalism as a problem to be overcome.
2. Nationalism is necessary to get people to work productive together. It is linked to processes like 
industrialization (you need people to work in the factories, to send their children to work in the 
factories and this need for labour produces institutions like the school etc. that teach the value of hard 
work and working from 9 to 5 to make productive factory workers. In other words, these scholars see 
nationalism as a tool that develops modern systems and institutions.)
3. Nationalism as connected to ethnic inheritance. There is an identity you are born with that forms 
the basis for the nation.
4. Nationalism as a new cultural creation (a collective community “imagined” into existence. Much 
like the discussion in (2) this form of scholarship argues that the creation of nationalism served a 
particular purpose.


Defining the State
The state is undeniably a messy concept. The main problem is that most
definitions contain two different levels of analysis, the 'institutional' and
the 'functional'. That is, the state can be defined in terms of what it looks
like, institutionally, or what it does, its functions. Predominant is a
mixed, but largely institutional, view put forward originally by Weber. In
this the state contains four main elements, being:
1 a differentiated set of institutions and personnel, embodying
2 centrality, in the sense that political relations radiate outwards from a
centre to cover a
3 territorially demarcated area, over which it exercises
4 a monopoly of authoritative binding rule-making, backed up by a
monopoly of the means of physical violence.10
Apart from the last phrase which tends to equate the state with mili-
tary force (see below), I will follow this definition. It is still something of
a mixed bag. It contains a predominant institutional element: states can
be recognized by the central location of their differentiated institutions.
Yet it also contains a 'functional' element: the essence of the state's func-
tions is a monopoly of binding rule-making.





Section 1:
Different strands of social theory have seen “nationalism” in different ways. Although
Calhoun tells the reader that there are 4 strands, these actually intersect with one
another.
1. Nationalism is used by elites to gain or maintain control. It is therefore tied
to forms of oppression or conflict. These scholars see nationalism as a problem
to be overcome.
2. Nationalism is necessary to get people to work productive together. It is linked
to processes like industrialization (you need people to work in the factories, to
send their children to work in the factories and this need for labour produces
institutions like the school etc. that teach the value of hard work and working
from 9 to 5 to make productive factory workers. In other words, these scholars
see nationalism as a tool that develops modern systems and institutions.)
3. Nationalism as connected to ethnic inheritance. There is an identity you are
born with that forms the basis for the nation.
4. Nationalism as a new cultural creation (a collective community “imagined”
into existence. Much like the discussion in (2) this form of scholarship argues
that the creation of nationalism served a particular purpose.
Question to think about: Can you think of an example to illustrate any one of these
nationalisms.
Section 2: Nationalism and the Production of Societies
The idea of a collective “nation” gives society (which may otherwise be divided on
linguistic, cultural or ethnic lines) a unified identity that gives a coherent sense of self.
This idea has a political purpose. If you are one people/one nation, you can justify
being ruled by one government. The legitimacy of the power of the government, comes
from the idea of the nation.
The idea of the nation is maintained by political power, but also through everyday
practices like national celebrations and holidays.
A nation is usually (but not always) associated with a territory. It unites a group of
people who are said to have the same history, language and culture. They actually have
none of these things, but through the reliance on a single story of the nation, they
believe they do. This is why Calhoun (in your main reading) says that a definition of the
term “nation” or “nationalism” has never become universal (p. 521). Yet everyone uses
it because, according to Calhoun, “nationalism is a discursive formation” (p. 521).
**How do we know what a nation is?
Tutorial: What nation are you part of? What country are you a citizen of? Can the
answer to the first two questions be different? Explain.
Section 3 and 4: “Ethnic and Civic Nationalism” & “Modernity vs Primordiality”
Ethnic nationalism (based on identity rooted in kinship, language and race or language).
Tends to be associated with competing claims for power on the basis of this identity and
historically, has been linked to violence on that basis in the form of ethnic cleansing or
genocide.
Civic nationalism: rooted purely on political identity. This includes the adaptation
of national identity by choice. However, in reality, the two tend to overlap. The
examples we discuss in class will highlight this.
*Can you think of global examples of how civic nationalism has been challenged by racial
or ethnic identity?
On p. 522-523 Calhoun discusses how the major conflict between scholars has been
about whether nationalism is based on long histories and older ethnic structures or
whether it is a modern phenomena that has created new forms of identity. Calhoun
clearly agrees with the latter, as do most modern-day scholars. We will briefly also
discuss Kedourie, Chatterjee and Gellner in class).
The nation does invent new identities, but just because it invents them, does not mean
they are false. This is one of the crucial points that distinguishes Gellner from Anderson.
Please see p. 523 for further details.
There is no agreement on when nationalism began. Its mythic origins, according
to Calhoun are less important than seeing it as “drawing together several different
threads of historical change.” In other words, Calhoun is saying exactly what we
discussed today. Nationalism did not emerge in any one country at any single moment in
time. To understand Nationalism as part of the world we live in, we need to understand
that it has multiple stories, each of which have their own myth of origin and all of these
stories teach us about how power works in the world today.
Reading 1: Joanne Yao and Andrew Delatolla. “Race and Historical International
Relations,” in Routledge Handbook of Historical International Relations (eds) Benjamin de
Carvalho et. al. (Routledge, 2021).
The idea of “race” and “civilization” being part of the global system has an “origin myth”.
What is this “origin myth”?
From your reading (p. 192): “This myth proposes a global history tied to
assumptions of …Western superiority, and its effects can be felt in much of
Western historiography. This view…helped structure domestic political hierarchies in
much of the world and informed the development of modern International Relations
(IR).
Example: we all study in English or French in Canada because of the colonial idea that
these languages had more to offer the world. As more and more people write and study
in English and French this becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.
Examples of global challenges we will be discussing in class from around the world:
Iran and the change in textbooks after the Irani Revolution. Contemporary Iran and
nationalism.
Myanmar and the Rohingya crisis
