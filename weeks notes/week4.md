# Week 4
## political globalization
theme 8, 9

8. **International development, inequality, and its impacts (Case study: Brazil’s rainforest mafia)**: International development often exacerbates inequality, as seen in Brazil’s rainforest mafia, where authoritarian states and global markets drive resource exploitation. These dynamics prioritize profit over local communities, fueling environmental and social harm. The case reveals how global demand perpetuates local inequities.

9. **Understanding the groups/stakeholders in society and the role they play in the international system**: Various stakeholders—governments, NGOs, corporations, and communities—shape global interactions and power dynamics. Their roles reflect competing interests, influencing policies and outcomes in the international system. Recognizing their influence is crucial for understanding global governance.

### UN
The United Nations (UN) was established in response to the devastation caused by World War II, with the goal of preventing future wars, promoting peace, and fostering international cooperation.


Date	Event
1919	League of Nations formed after WWI, but failed to prevent WWII.
1941 (Aug)	Atlantic Charter signed by U.S. President Roosevelt and British PM Churchill – outlined vision for post-war peace.
1942 (Jan 1)	"Declaration by United Nations" – 26 Allied nations pledged to fight Axis powers and uphold the Atlantic Charter. First use of the term “United Nations.”
1944 (Oct)	Dumbarton Oaks Conference (U.S.) – drafted the basic structure of the UN.
1945 (Apr–Jun)	San Francisco Conference – 50 countries met to finalize the UN Charter.
1945 (June 26)	UN Charter signed by 50 states.
1945 (Oct 24)	United Nations officially established, after Charter was ratified. (This is now celebrated as United Nations Day.)


What Pushed the Formation of the UN:

1. Failure of the League of Nations
• Could not prevent aggression by Axis powers in the 1930s.
• Lacked enforcement power and U.S. membership.
2. Devastation of World War II
• Tens of millions dead, widespread destruction.
• Global consensus on the need for a new, effective international organization.
3. Desire for Global Peace and Security
• Prevent another world war.
• Promote diplomacy over conflict.
4. Need for International Cooperation
• Address issues like refugees, rebuilding economies, human rights, and health (e.g. epidemics).

Founding Principles of the UN:
Maintain international peace and security
Promote human rights and freedoms
Foster economic and social development
Uphold international law
Provide a platform for dialogue and diplomacy


### ICC
The ICC is a permanent international court that prosecutes individuals (not states) for the most serious crimes:

Genocide

War crimes

Crimes against humanity

Crime of aggression

Established: 2002, by the Rome Statute (1998)
HQ: The Hague, Netherlands
Members: 123 countries (not including the U.S., China, Russia)
Jurisdiction: Over crimes committed by nationals of or in ICC member states, or referred by the UN
Security Council

how it works
• Investigates and prosecutes individuals (e.g. political leaders, generals)
• Can act only when national courts can't or won't prosecute
• Prosecutor leads investigations, judges issue rulings

limitation
No police force -+ depends on member states to arrest suspects
Some powerful countries don't recognize its authority
Criticized for focusing too heavily on Africa

### ICJ
The International Court of Justice (ICJ) is the principal judicial organ of the United Nations, established to settle legal disputes between states and give advisory opinions on international legal issues.


Date	Event
1945	ICJ established by the UN Charter (Chapter XIV) at the San Francisco Conference.
1946	Replaced the Permanent Court of International Justice (from League of Nations era).
1946 (April 18)	Officially began work.
Headquarters	The Hague, Netherlands.

Structure of the ICJ:
15 judges elected for 9-year terms by the UN General Assembly and Security Council.
Judges are independent and represent different legal systems and world regions.
Cannot include more than one judge from the same country.


1. Contentious Cases (Binding Rulings):
• Between sovereign states only (e.g. border disputes, treaty interpretation).
• Both parties must consent to IO jurisdiction.
• Rulings are legally binding, but the IO has no enforcement power—states must voluntarily comply or
face diplomatic pressure or UN Security Council involvement
2. Advisory Opinions (Non-binding):
• Requested by UN bodies or specialized agencies (e.g. UNESCO, WHO).
• Opinions clarify international law but don't impose obligations.

Limitations of the ICJ:
Only states (not individuals, companies, or NGOs) can be parties in cases.
Enforcement relies on state cooperation or the UN Security Council.
Jurisdiction is based on state consent; many powerful countries (like the U.S.) do not accept compulsory jurisdiction.

The ICJ plays a key role in:
Promoting peaceful resolution of disputes.
Clarifying and developing international law.
Supporting the UN’s mission of justice and diplomacy.
