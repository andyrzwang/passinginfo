# Week 8
## international migration, visa regimes and race
12. Migration (specifically the
movement and mixing of people from
across the world) has been crucial to
how global societies have evolved.
(Therefore, denying that diversity is a
political act.)

3. (Chan and the UN World Migration Report which tells usa small minority of the world’s population lives in a country other than the one they were born in)


## notes

**understanding legal restrictions on migration**
- Legal restrictions on human migration are a recent phenomena. 
- Before there were nation-states, it was far easier to travel. 

It is safer to travel currently, but need visa and documents


**Human migration and identity**
voluntary and involuntary migration

involuntary migration
- deportation
- slavery
- war
- natural disaster
- climate refugees

what is human migration
Simply put, this term refers to the movement of people. There are many different types of migration. However, by far the most important difference discussed in your reading is the difference between voluntary and involuntary migration.

Immigration: moving into a new country
Emigration: leaving a country to move to another one.
Internal migration: moving within a country, continent or other region.
External migration: moving to a different country, continent or other region.

**distribution**
people move to more developing country, with better opportunity and human rights...

History - already exists many migrations, exits resources and networks
Wealthy country - get job, get money, send money back home
Ease of travel - visa restrictions, political instability /

**history**
african slave migration from 1440s to 1870s

migration of free and indentured mena dn women across Asia

Russo–Siberian migration across parts of  Asia, North America, and Europe; 

a North China–Manchurian migration; 

and an Atlantic system connecting Europe and the Americas

## reading summary

This section argues that wars and empires have been the single largest factor contributing to
this type of migration.
**Think back to the last lecture. What kind of involuntary migration did we discuss last
week? Is this similar to what this week’s reading is arguing?

In the task of Empire building, people from Europe went to areas that they saw as “empty
continents”. Some of the people who went to engage in what we now call “settler
colonialism” came to build a new life, others were moved as “indentured workers”. However,
plantation owners wanted a more permanent source of labour because indentured workers
were considered free as soon as the term of service (usually previously agreed upon) was
over. This is part of the consideration that went into the large-scale transportation of
kidnapped people from the African coasts to the plantations in the Americas. This large-scale
migration numbered in the millions.

After slavery ended, Indian and Chinese indentured workers were used to replace this labour
to continue the production on plantations.

These waves of forced migration meant that people across Asia and Africa arrived in the
Americas but had very little rights or protections because they were mainly being brought in
as forced labour.

**Involuntary Migration and Land Empires**
In this section your reading carries this idea forward by explaining how land empires (like the
Chinese under the Qing Dynasty) rewarded soldiers for service by giving them pieces of land
to settle in other areas. When these soldiers moved to the land they had been given, they
became soldier migrants.

**Involuntary Migration as Punishment**
In this section your reading discusses many examples (such as the Armenian Genocide and
the 1937 deportation of 170,000 Koreans from one part of Russia to another) of involuntary
migration as punishment. Some of these forced migrations produced permanent
demographic changes. Others are important as stories told by ethnic communities of how
they were treated badly. One example that you could compare within the Canadian context
is of the Great Upheaval of French settlers.
Involuntary Migration and the Dissolution of Empires continues this theme, but discussed
how war and the end of an empire has also resulted in the displacement of thousands of
people.

**Voluntary Migration**
This section discusses the old migration of Europeans as the early migrants from Europe to
the Americas who were moving to settle there for economic reasons and to acquire farmland.

From the 1920s restrictive legislation limited this migration, mainly putting restrictions on
migration from the South and Central Europe as well as racist restrictions on Asian migrants.
We will discuss how this situation changed in the 1960s.

Workers also entered into contracts to do work overseas. A large proportion of this group
were women. In the contemporary world. Skills and education were important in the
distinctive positions occupied by this group.
