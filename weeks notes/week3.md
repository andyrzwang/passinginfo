## slides - Economic globalization
neoliberalism
Neoliberalism is contemporarily used to refer to market-oriented reform policies such as "eliminating price controls, deregulating capital markets, lowering trade barriers" and reducing, especially through privatization and austerity, state influence in the economy.
- free market global capitalism
- shrinks the size of gov
- market decides policies
- best benefits for individuals
- encourage transnational collaboration

BUT
- exacerbates inequalities
- government policies support the vulnerable
- contains violence


**globalization**
Globalization: the increasing connectedness of the world. This often produces interdependence both in global cultures and in economies. (source: NatGeo).

economic globalization: the increasing interdependence of national economies through the flow of goods, services, technology, capital, and people across borders

**capitalism**





## summary
What is economic globalization?
“ [it] refers to the intensification and stretching of economic connections across the globe.
Gigantic flows of capital mediated by digital technology and standardized means of
transportation have stimulated trade in goods and services.” (p. 39)
**Can you think of an example that illustrates the meaning of each one of the phrases in
bold?
Transnational economic organizations are now essential in the regulation of global markets
(i.e. this process is not just controlled and regulated by governments).
**The hidden story here is that some countries (or states) are more powerful than others.
Therefore, they have more of a say in how transnational economic organizations operate.
Even in economic globalization, power inequalities are reproduced.
Section 1: The emergence of the global order
Your reading discusses the Bretton Woods Conference (1944). This is important because this
is the conference that led to the formation of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD). The IBRD later became the
World Bank.
Extra information: At this time (1944) the main role of the IMF was to maintain a fixed
exchange rate pegged to both gold and the US dollar. The role of the IBRD was to provide
assistance to European countries that had been affected by the war.
Through the 1960s, all the way to 1989, there were 4 other institutions that joined the IBRD
in making the World Bank Group as it is called today.
**Why did the Bretton Woods conference happen?
What your reading refers to as the “Bretton Woods Regime”(BWR) was characterized by
“controlled capitalism”.
**What is capitalism?
This referred to capitalism with state intervention as the famous economist, John Maynard
Keynes argued was essential.
In the 1970s, the golden days of controlled capitalism (and the BWR by extension) came to
an end shortly after President Richard Nixon abandoned the gold standard (p. 41 in you
reading). This, according to your reading, was the time when neoliberalism and neoliberal
policies came to replace the economic policies referred to as “controlled capitalism”. The rise
of Margaret Thatcher in the UK and Ronald Reagan in the US were an important corollary to
this.
**What is neoliberalism (answer on p. 41).
Section 2: The internationalization of trade and finance
The main concepts discussed here are economic integration and the controversial policies
that promote free trade.
Privatization, reducing the power of unions, reducing the amount of tax people have to pay,
increasing the power of international agencies to intervene in trade without having to go
through too much red tape are all policies which, theoretically promote free trade and
neoliberalism.
**do these policies sound like a good thing or a bad thing for ordinary people? What kind of
impact would they have for individuals in a country? (these questions relate to the tutorial
questions at the beginning of the document.
On p. 47 your reading describes the “financialization of global capitalism”. What does this
refer to?
Section 3: A global era of economic volatility
This section discusses the Global Financial Crisis of 2008. This was preceded by economic
policies put in place between the 1980s and 1990s which deregulated financial services
allowing for much more speculation in financial affairs than before. This speculation, based
on predictions of what would become more viable in the future or betting on stocks and
investments that did not even yet exist, was one of the main reasons why companies like
major lending and financial institutions in the US were left vulnerable when the downturn in
American real estate hit in mid 2007. Their predictions were wrong and major organizations
like Goldman Sachs had to declare bankruptcy (p. 49-50).
The GFC spread across the world, but most in Europe and the US.
Section 4: The power of transnational corporations
This section discusses how giant companies manage to gain a foothold and become major
players in the world economy. Their ability to spread their manufacturing and portion out
tasks to create a global value chain is crucial to understanding how they command the
power that they do in the globalized world economy.
**Can you think of an example?
**how is power and exploitation an important part of the story of the rise of these
corporations (we will look at No Logo by Naomi Klein).
Section 5: The enhanced role of international economic institutions
Second set of tutorial questions
**Read the box in this section that talks about Nokia. What is the point of telling the reader
that Nokia managed to bounce back from the GFC?
** What about major players who are planning lay-offs, like google (see here:
https://blog.google/inside-google/message-ceo/january-update/) Do you think they will be
affected more than Nokia was?



Second reading – The postcolonial perspective: an introduction, by Charlotte Epstein.
The main point we will explore is how norms, ideas and assumptions were crafted during
colonial rule and how they, in turn, affect how we view the world.
Your reading says colonial officials were “norm entrepreneurs” (they were in the business of
constructing and selling norms (p. 296). What does Charlotte Epstein (the author, mean by
by this)
Questions to think about (that I will answer for your in class):
1. what is “colonial rule” in a global sense? If you were asked to give a 5-10 minute
primer, to a group of people who had never heard the term before, how would you
explain “colonial rule” to them?
2. Who is a “colonial official”?
3. How was colonial rule (and colonial officials) involved in the formation of the modern
world as we know it today?
Definitions:
What is settler colonialism?
Patrick Wolfe discusses “settler colonialism” as the systemic elimination of indigenous
peoples. It can take the form of genocide but did not have to.
For Glen Coulthard settler colonialism is a “form of structured dispossession” of indigenous
peoples in which their land and authority is taken from them. It is maintained in the
contemporary period not be state violence, but by the politics of “recognition”. In other
words, Coulthard says this idea that to recognize authority is the same as giving back
authority is the way in which colonialism continues to dispossess. He calls for a rejection of
the “politics of recognition.”
So, settler colonialism is the dispossession of indigenous peoples from land, title and
authority. It is ongoing. It requires constant reproduction.
