# Week 10
## population and environment
theme 13, 8, 5, 11

13. Institutions and the conditions for prosperity or development are created in specific circumstances. They cannot be explained outside of those circumstances.

8. International development, inequality and its impacts (Case study: Brazil’s rainforest mafia are built by authoritarian states and institutions that are not responsive to the people combined with resource wars and profits to be made in the global market). 

5. Globalization and its impacts.

11. Our understanding of “security” and of what constitutes a threat to that security “is framed by our membership in particular communities and ideologies” (Smallman & Brown).


## notes

increasing poverty and climate change

world population is increasing, about 8 billion right now
project 9 billion in 2046

while the population in more developed country is flat,
developing and less developed countries like africa, india and china increase

causes of population explosion
- agricultural revolution
- increased food supply - increase nutrition, farming, harvesting
- industrial revolution
- improve transportation for goods
- improve living condition
- innovation
- life expectancy
- public health - vaccines
represents prosperity for some groups, can also mean decrease in quality of life


**does population growth contribute to poverty?**
- limited resources
- increase demand
- increase competing


### climate change
death in country don't have AC.
- death can be point towards climate change

reduce greenhouse gases
2015 paris agreement
dirty air - pollution


## reading 1 - population
people move towards urban area = more opportunity, better life
- in developing countries

birth rate is dropping in wealthy country

a large proportion of the population in these countries is mainly nonproductive. Food,
education, and healthcare must be provided for children and youth until they become
independent. Obviously, if a nation has a large portion of its population in the under-15 age
group, its economy will be faced with a significant burden to provide for its younger
members.

If the
population is too large or the growth too rapid, people's use of the country's resources for
food and income can actually prevent the biological natural resources from renewing
themselves. 

A large population of young people also means that there will be a terrific demand for jobs
when these children grow old enough to join the labor force – jobs that are unlikely to exist.


slow growth
a slow population growth rate has the potential to impede
a country's productive capacity, and therefore also its economic growth





## reading 2 - population and climate change

This article outlines how four major factors—population, economics, culture, and environment—interact in complex ways to influence climate change. Between 2010 and 2050, the global population is expected to become larger, older, more urban, with most urban growth happening in developing countries.

While population growth alone doesn't fully explain the dramatic rise in carbon emissions, it contributes alongside economic expansion and increased use of fossil fuels. Carbon emissions in developing countries have grown especially rapidly, outpacing population growth and exceeding the rate in high-income nations.

Demographic trends—such as household size, settlement patterns, and the aging population—will continue to affect climate change dynamics. Meanwhile, climate change disproportionately harms poorer people and nations, affecting housing, food security, and health.

Cohen proposes three effective, equity-based responses:

Universal secondary education

Voluntary family planning and maternal health care

Smarter urban design and infrastructure

These solutions benefit both climate and social development, making them essential for both rich and poor countries alike.
