The relationship between population growth and urban growth, as articulated by John L. Seitz in the first 10 pages of *Chapter 1: Population* from *Global Issues: An Introduction*, is deeply intertwined, with population growth acting as a significant driver of urban expansion, particularly in less wealthy countries. Seitz explains that as the global population has increased exponentially—reaching milestones like 7 billion by 2011 and projected to hit 8 billion by 2024—the movement of people from rural to urban areas has accelerated. This migration is fueled by the hope of better economic opportunities and living conditions in cities, a trend most pronounced in developing nations where population growth remains high.

Seitz highlights that the rapid population increase, especially post-World War II due to lowered death rates from health improvements, has led to a surge in the number of people needing jobs, housing, and services. In poorer countries, where nearly all future population growth is expected to occur (projected to rise from 6 billion in 2015 to 8.2 billion by 2050), this growth disproportionately swells urban areas. He notes that by 2009, more people globally lived in urban than rural areas, with the United Nations anticipating that future population growth will predominantly occur in the urban zones of less wealthy nations. This shift is exemplified by the rise of "megacities" (cities with over 10 million people), which grew from six in developing countries in 1990 to 28 worldwide by 2014, many in emerging economies.

The author suggests that population growth and urban growth go hand in hand due to several interconnected factors. First, high birth rates in less developed regions create a youthful population (often under 15), which, as it matures, seeks opportunities unavailable in rural areas, driving migration to cities. Figure 1.4 illustrates this with pyramid-shaped age structures in growing populations, contrasting with stable, column-shaped structures in wealthier, slower-growing nations. Second, economic development, though uneven, pulls people toward urban centers where industrial and service sectors are concentrated, even if jobs are scarce, leading to the proliferation of slums (e.g., 32.7% of urban dwellers in developing regions lived in informal settlements by 2012). Third, Seitz points to historical patterns, such as the agricultural and industrial revolutions, which boosted population by increasing food supply and living standards, subsequently concentrating people in urban areas as rural economies could no longer sustain them.

Seitz also emphasizes the consequences of this linkage: urban growth often outpaces infrastructure development, resulting in overcrowding, pollution, and substandard living conditions, as seen in cities like Calcutta, projected to reach 19 million by 2030. He contrasts this with innovative urban responses in places like Curitiba, Brazil, where population pressures spurred sustainable solutions like efficient public transportation, suggesting that urban growth, while challenging, can catalyze adaptive strategies.

In summary, Seitz views population growth as a catalyst for urban growth because it generates a surplus of people—particularly in less wealthy nations—who migrate to cities seeking better prospects, a trend historically reinforced by economic and technological shifts. The two phenomena are linked by the dynamics of demographic pressure, economic opportunity, and the limits of rural sustainability, creating a feedback loop where growing populations fuel urban expansion, often with significant social and environmental ramifications.
